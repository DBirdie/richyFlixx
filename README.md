# RichyFlix

RichyFlix is ​​a web application built primarily on Node.JS, using the MERN stack. MongoDB for the database, Express for middleware and API handling, React as the frontend engine, and Node.JS to run everything together, with server-side javascript.

RichyFlix is ​​basically an advanced CRUD, since its functions do not go beyond allowing the user to Create, Read, Update and Delete Movies from their collections.

Another function of my application is an authentication system, with it I keep all routes protected, including user profiles and their movie collections.

to make richyflix i got my inspiration from netflix, and its primary funcitons like play movies, and have colections, trendings etc... actually there is where the name "richyflix" came

thanks to all the cs50 staff!
